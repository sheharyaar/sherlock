## Sherlock

A simple debugger using `ptrace` and other required techniques to debug Linux programs. Some features may not be implemented as this is only a learning project.

> This is work in progress. Stay tuned for updates.

### TODOs

- [X] Implement a parser/grammar API for getting the actions, entities, and intents from the text input.
  - Used strtok for basic parsing.
- [ ] Implement breakpoint support using INT.
- [ ] Implement debugger symbol support for variables and functions.
- [ ] Implement stack unwinding / backtrace support.

Additional nice to haves:
- [ ] hex, binary and string printing
- [ ] relative addressing modes (with file base, instruction pointer) when using commands like print
